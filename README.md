# React-Repository


<p>

This is a very simple React App, yet it uses some quite essential features of React. It uses a dummy backend to fetch the data via the API and renders the list of users. There is a search bar provided on the top which filters out the users simultaneously. This project can be considered as a building block for a more intensive React Application.
